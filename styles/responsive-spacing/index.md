## Grid

The Design System uses an 8 pixel grid. This defines the width, height and spacing of all components and patterns we use.

Sizes are multiples of 8 pixels. This is to make sure the components we create in the Design System fit on the grid and align on the page.

## Responsive spacing scale

The Design System uses a responsive spacing scale. This is for consistent use of spacing which adapts to different screen sizes.

The scale is made up of  of 10 spacing units. Each unit has a specific size for use on large and small screens.


<table class="ds_table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Spacing unit</th>
      <th scope="col">0</th>
      <th scope="col">1</th>
      <th scope="col">2</th>
      <th scope="col">3</th>
      <th scope="col">4</th>
      <th scope="col">5</th>
      <th scope="col">6</th>
      <th scope="col">7</th>
      <th scope="col">8</th>
      <th scope="col">9</th>
    </tr>

      <td>56px</td>

      <td>24px</td>
      <td>32px</td>

## Why we use this scale

Using the scale ensures the spacing of components and patterns is consistent on digital sites or services.

The scale’s range is enough to balance interactive elements with white space. This helps to define the structure and visual hierarchy in all compositions.

The scale adapts to different screen sizes. This helps to maximise the use of space on smaller screens.

The scale is flexible. You can select units for spacing based on any particular layout. This is for both vertical and horizontal spacing.

## Spacing rules

We’re working on guidance to standardise spacing for components often used together, such as form fields. We’ll add this to the Design System when it's available.
