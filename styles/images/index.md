## Photography

### Aspect ratios

When using photographs we recommend using standard aspect ratios such as 1:1, 4:3, 3:2 and 16:9

<figure class="example__content">
<img alt="Box shapes representing the four recommended image aspect ratios" src="/assets/images/ratios-image.png">
<figcaption>Our image aspect ratios</figcaption>
</figure>

## Illustrations

Preference for illustration over photography may occur when:

* there is no suitable photography for content
* a photograph may be too complex
* visualising data

## Using images

### Images in article content

Article templates allow images that are aligned left in the page. The recommended width for an image in article content is 750px.

<figure class="example__content">
<img alt="A photograph spans over eight columns on the page layout and is left-aligned." src="/assets/images/article-image.png">
<figcaption>Column positioning for images in an article page</figcaption>
</figure>

### Images in category headers

Category headers allow images that are aligned right in the page. The recommended width for an image in a category header is 358px.

<figure class="example__content">
<img alt="A photograph spans over four columns on the category header and is right-aligned." src="/assets/images/category-image.png">
<figcaption>Column positioning for images in an category header component</figcaption>
</figure>

## Informational images

Other types of imagery can be considered such as logos, icons and diagrams to support information.

## Accessibility

Images must always be supported with text alternatives which are descriptive of the information they present. Alternative text is read out by screen readers for users with visual impairments and where an image does not load. Text should never be included as part of the image as this will not be read out by screen readers or translated by automated translators.

W3C gives guidance on [how to make images accessible](#).
