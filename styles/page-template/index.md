Pages built using the Design System should use this template as a starting point.

{% include example-frame.html title="Example HTML for page template" name="code" no-demo=true html-expanded=true  %}

## Page top

This area is used for things that are common across a site, such as notifications, main navigation, and the site header.

## Page middle

This is where your main content goes. Use the Design System's [layout component](/styles/layout/) to define how the various parts of a page are arranged.

## Page bottom

This area is used for the site footer. It is forced to the bottom of the browser window if a page is shorter than the user's browser.
