We use Google Analytics to collect information about how you use designsystem.gov.scot.

We store information about:
* the pages you visit and how long you spend on each page
* how you got to designsystem.gov.scot
* what you click on while you're visiting designsystem.gov.scot

We do not:
* collect information that can be used to identify you; for example, we never receive your name or address
* make any attempt to find out the identities of people visiting designsystem.gov.scot
* allow the tools that we use to find out the identities of people visiting designsystem.gov.scot
* sell, trade or give your details to third parties, unless we are required to do it by law

All information we get through cookies and analytics will be treated in confidence.

We anonymise the last 3 digits of all designsystem.gov.scot user IP addresses for Google Analytics, so that we can ensure that you are protected ([you can read more about how this works here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en)). We can only see a general overview of which regions and cities you may come from, not where individuals access from.
