Before designing a new digital form, or updating an existing one, it is critical that the service's requirements and the user needs are fully understood. User research must be undertaken to map the user journeys and drive what the form's content should be.

The following activities should be considered when developing the form content.

## Identify all the information you need to collect

Based on your research findings make a list of all the information your form needs to collect from users. This becomes the basis to designing the form questions.

## Review the form questions 

Once you know what information to collect, validate this using a tool called a ['question protocol'](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#know-why-youre-asking-every-question). This step helps you identify which form questions you need and can be used to reduce the size of a form.

The protocol should be used to check that for each question asked you know:

- why you need the information to deliver your service
- what you'll do with it
- which users need to give you the information
- how you'll check the information is accurate
- how to keep the information up to date and secure

If a question asks for more than one piece of information they all should be reviewed against the above list.

<div class="ds_inset-text">
    <div class="ds_inset-text__text">
        Keep your forms as simple as possible. Only ask what's needed to run your service.
    </div>
</div>

## Each form question has costs

Only ask for information that is needed for your service because each question has a cost. A financial cost is incurred by the organisation publishing the form, who must process and store the answers. A time and cognitive cost is passed on to users for every extra question they have to complete. 

## Clearly explain why you're asking for sensitive information

Users care about their privacy and information security. If you must ask for sensitive information, make sure you explain why it is needed at the point in the form it appears.

## Form question content design

When you know what information to collect, you should follow [content best practices](https://resources.mygov.scot/content-standards/) to design the questions that should be asked.

You should with a content designer to create form content that is written in plain English to help users understand what is being asked.
