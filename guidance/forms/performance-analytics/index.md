Tracking how users interact with forms allows teams to analyse user journeys and try to improve the forms over time. For example, by:
- providing simpler help for misunderstood questions
- rewording or reordering questions that are not filled in correctly
- splitting complex questions into simpler questions

When a form consists of multiple pages, you should track which part the user is on to record errors and provide data about how your form is used. Fields which are skipped, invalid or returned to can tell you a lot about the issues users are facing. This will be either the page's URL or, where a form does not change the address when a new page loads, have custom tracking events enabled.

If you are using the Design System, other interactions with components will be handled by the Design System's custom tracking. If you are not using the Design System, you should ask a performance analyst to ensure your tracking covers what you need to collect to measure your form's performance.
