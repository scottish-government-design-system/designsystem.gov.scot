It is important to carry out usability testing on forms you design. Try to test as early and as often as possible, with real users of your service.

Ask users to 'think out loud' when completing the form in order to capture qualitative data. Prepare questions such as 'were you expecting to be asked this question' if the participant goes quiet.

## Accessibility Testing

Automated accessibility testing can be carried out by developers, quality assurance (QA) testers, or anyone involved in the project lifecycle. These are quick tests that can be completed using browser extensions and online tools to provide immediate feedback on whether forms are accessible. 

Automated accessibility testing cannot identify all accessibility issues and should be combined with manual accessibility testing and usability testing done with disabiled people. This is essential for full accessibility coverage and compliance.
