The components used to build forms within the Design System are some of the most commonly used items on our site. This is due in part to the work being done across Scottish Government to build good quality digital services. Our engagement with teams using our Design System has identified the need to expand our portfolio of form components as well as provide form layouts and guidance on good form design.

Whether it is a login form, a complicated form with multiple steps or a simple data entry interface, forms are an essential part of a digital service because they allow a transaction to take place.

Use these guidelines as a starting point to design and create your digital forms.
