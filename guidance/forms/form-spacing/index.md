Spacing is an important factor in creating an effective form layout. Placing form labels near the associated text field and grouping related fields helps users to complete forms more quickly with less confusion.

The following examples illustrate how the layout of form elements can help users.




## Label and field spacing

Ensure that each label and its field are clearly associated with each other and separated from surrounding labels and fields.

Uniform spacing makes it unclear which label relates to which field and may cause incorrect user inputs. This can be avoided by the proper use of spacing so that the user can quickly identify which label relates to which field.

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with equal spacing between field labels, text inputs and the pairs of labels and inputs that follow them. The equal spacing is also demonstrated with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-field-spacing-incorrect.svg" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Equal spacing between all labels and fields makes it unclear to users which label relates to which field when there are several inputs.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with wider spacing between pairs of labels and text inputs than the space between a label and its associated text input. The wider spacing is also demonstrated with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-field-spacing-correct.svg" loading="lazy">

## Group spacing

Just as with field and label spacing, it is important to separate groups of inputs. Uniform or too little spacing between groups can make it difficult for a user to quickly understand the structure of the form.

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with the same spacing between groups of form fields as the spacing between form fields within a group. The equal spacing is also demonstrated with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-group-spacing-incorrect.svg" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Unclear spacing between grouped fields makes it difficult to discern the form structure.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with wider spacing between groups of form fields than the spacing between form fields within a group. The wider spacing is also demonstrated with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-group-spacing-correct.svg" loading="lazy">

## Component spacing

Ensure clear spacing so that each form component is discinct and easy to scan for the user.

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
