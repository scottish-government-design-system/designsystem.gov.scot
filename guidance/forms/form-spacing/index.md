Spacing is an important factor in creating an effective form layout. Placing form labels near the associated text field and grouping related fields helps users to complete forms more quickly with less confusion.

The following examples illustrate how the layout of form elements can help users.

Image label: Even spacing between all labels and fields makes it unclear to users which label relates to which field when there are several inputs.

Image label: Labels should be closer to their associated field and have clear spacing from neighbouring fields.

Image label: Unclear spacing between grouped fields makes it difficult to discern the intended form structure.

Image label: Ensure adequate spacing between grouped fields to help users quickly identify the form structure.

Image label: Ensure each form component has adequate spacing. Here the primary action button is closer to the second radio button than the radio buttons are to each other

Image label: Adequate spacing creates a clear hierarchy
