Spacing is an important factor in creating an effective form layout. Placing form labels near the associated text field and grouping related fields helps users to complete forms more quickly with less confusion.

The following examples illustrate how the layout of form elements can help users.




## Field spacing

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with equal spacing between field labels, text inputs and the pairs of labels and inputs that follow them. The equal spacing is emphasised with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-field-spacing-incorrect.svg" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Even spacing between all labels and fields makes it unclear to users which label relates to which field when there are several inputs.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with wider spacing between pairs of labels and text inputs than the space between a label and its associated text input. The wider spacing is emphasised with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-field-spacing-correct.svg" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Labels should be closer to their associated field and have clear spacing from neighbouring fields.</figcaption>
</figure>




## Group spacing

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with the same spacing between groups of form fields as the spacing between form fields within a group. The equal spacing is emphasised with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-group-spacing-incorrect.svg" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Unclear spacing between grouped fields makes it difficult to discern the form structure.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with wider spacing between groups of form fields than the spacing between form fields within a group. The wider spacing is emphasised with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-group-spacing-correct.svg" loading="lazy">

## Component spacing

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with a narrow gap between some radio button inputs and a 'next' button. The small gap is emphasised with a ruler between the fields and the button." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-components-incorrect.svg" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Ensure each form component has adequate spacing. Here the primary action button is closer to the second radio button than the radio buttons are to each other.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with a wide gap between some radio button inputs and a 'next' button. The wide gap is emphasised with a ruler between the fields and the button." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-components-correct.svg" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Adequate spacing between components maintains a clear hierarchy.</figcaption>
