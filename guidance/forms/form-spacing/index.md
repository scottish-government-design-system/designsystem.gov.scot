When creating an effective form, spacing is important. Placing form labels near the associated text field and grouping related fields helps users to complete forms quicker and with less confusion.

The following examples show how the layout of form elements can help users.




## Label and field spacing

Make sure that each label and its field are clearly associated with each other and separated from surrounding labels and fields. Equal spacing makes it unclear which label relates to which field. This may cause incorrect user inputs.

This can be avoided by the proper use of spacing so that the user can quickly identify which label relates to which field.

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with equal spacing between field labels, text inputs and the pairs of labels and inputs that follow them. The equal spacing is also demonstrated with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-field-spacing-incorrect.svg" loading="lazy">

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with wider spacing between pairs of labels and text inputs than the space between a label and its associated text input. The wider spacing is also demonstrated with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-field-spacing-correct.svg" loading="lazy">

## Group spacing

Just as with field and label spacing, it is important to separate groups of inputs. Uniform or not enough spacing between groups can make it difficult for to understand the form's structure.

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with the same spacing between groups of form fields as the spacing between form fields within a group. The equal spacing is also demonstrated with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-group-spacing-incorrect.svg" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Unclear spacing between grouped fields makes it difficult to understand the form structure.</figcaption>
</figure>

<img alt="A form with wider spacing between groups of form fields than the spacing between form fields within a group. The wider spacing is also demonstrated with an illustrated scale to the side of the form." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-group-spacing-correct.svg" loading="lazy">

## Component spacing

Make sure each part of the form is discinct and easy to scan for the user.

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with a narrow gap between some radio button inputs and a 'next' button. The small gap is called out with a ruler between the fields and the button." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-components-incorrect.svg" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Here the primary action button is closer to the second radio button than the radio buttons are to each other.</figcaption>

<figure class="overflow--large--2  overflow--xlarge--2">
<img alt="A form with a wide gap between some radio button inputs and a 'next' button. The wide gap is called out with a ruler between the fields and the button." src="/assets/images/illustrations/forms/spacing-components-correct.svg" loading="lazy">
