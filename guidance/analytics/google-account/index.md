If you’re going to be using Google Analytics you’ll need a [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp) which is tied to your work email address (rather than adding your work email address as a secondary address to a personal account). If you’re creating an account to be shared by a team we recommend creating a generic account, not only linking it to one individual and thinking ahead to secure against future resilience issues.




## Google account recovery

In the instance where there’s an existing Google Analytics account but access has been lost, you can recover it using the following steps:

* Identify the Google Analytics property ID you’re looking to recover - you can get this by navigating to one of your pages and using the Google Tag Assistant Chrome extension or by viewing the page source and looking for your UA code, which begins `UA-XXXXXX`.
* Log into Google AdWords. If you don’t have an existing account, create one and log in
* Once logged in, click the cog in the top right-hand corner and click on 'Worldwide phone support', pick the relevant number for your country and phone Google.
* Select the Analytics option, input your AdWords Customer ID (found in the top right of the AdWords webpage) and you’ll be directed to the support team.

It can be several days before resolution and account access is restored.
