Google AdWords is a pay-per-click (PPC) marketing platform. It’s good practice from a budgetary, risk, audit and management perspective to manage AdWords accounts in-house, delegating access/permissions to agencies and staff where necessary. For this there are two account options for organisations:

* [Standard AdWords account](https://adwords.google.com/home/) (applies to the majority)
* AdWords Manager Account (applies to organisations with multiple accounts)

It’s important to note that if you believe a management account is necessary, you should choose this option before setting up a standard account (otherwise, you’ll need to create another account if you’ve already set up a standard account). Your organisation will be best placed to get a Manager Account if you run multiple accounts across multiple sites or have complex budgetary and procurement structures.

The other reason you may require a Manager Account, is if you’re looking to apply for and use the Google AdWords API, where it’s a prerequisite.

To set up a Manager Account:

* [Create an account](https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/manager-accounts/)
* Once completed you’ll be taken to the dashboard. From here you can add any existing Google AdWords accounts or create an automatically linked account. Click the '+ Account' button and select the appropriate option from the dropdown.
