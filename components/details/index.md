## About this component

The details component is the Design System's implementation of the HTML 'details' element, with a fallback for older browsers that do not support HTML5.

## Why we use this component

The details component makes it so that users can 'opt in' to more detailed content if they need it, while keeping the page simple for users that do not need that content.

Do not use the details component to hide content that the majority of your users will need.

## Evidence

The GOV.UK Design System highlights some potential [usability and accessibility issues](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/#research-on-this-component) with the details element.
