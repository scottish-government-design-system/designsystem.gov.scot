We based our inset text component on the one built by GDS. [Find out more about the inset text component on GOV.UK’s Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/inset-text/).

## Website analytics
Each link in inset text blocks should be given a data attribute to help with tracking.

To understand user behaviour, clicks on links in inset text blocks can be tracked through the click URL, the click text and a data attribute showing the interaction, for example <code>data-navigation="information-link"</code>.
