We based our inset text component on the one built by GDS. [Find out more about the inset text component on GOV.UKâ€™s Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/inset-text/).

## Website analytics

To understand user behaviour, clicks on links in inset text blocks can be tracked through the click URL, the click text and a data attribute showing the interaction.

The data attribute is added automatically by the [Design System's 'tracking' script](/get-started/tracking/#inset-text).
