## About this component

Checkboxes allow users to pick any number of items from a list. Unlike [radio buttons](/components/radio-buttons/) which allow users to pick one option.

## Why we use this component

We use this component when we want users to be able to:

* pick one or more items from a list
* toggle between selecting and deselecting an option

If users should only pick one option from a list, you should use the [radio buttons](/components/radio-buttons/) component.

## Other versions of this component

### Checkboxes with hint text

Hint text can be added to checkboxes, just as it can to any other form component.

You can use hint text for more details about a checkbox. You should avoid adding hint text to the checkbox's label element.

{% include example-frame.html title="Checkbox example with hint text" name="hints" %}

### Small checkboxes

Although small checkboxes appear smaller, their clickable area is the same as normal checkboxes. This makes them easier for users to pick.

{% include example-frame.html title="Checkbox example with small checkboxes" name="small" %}

## Error messages

The error state for checkboxes marks the entire fieldset.

{% include example-frame.html title="Checkbox example with an error state" name="error" %}

## Website analytics

Checkbox items can be tracked through the original page path and a data attribute identifying the checkbox and its value, if set.

The data attribute is added automatically by the [Design System's 'tracking' script](/get-started/tracking/#checkboxes).

## Accessibility

We use a custom style for checkboxes so that they're larger and easier to use than the standard checkboxes defined by a browser. We also use a custom style to make their focussed and selected states clearer.

Checkboxes should only be stacked vertically. This makes tabbing through the checkboxes easier to follow. It also ensures better visibility of the options for screen magnifier users.
