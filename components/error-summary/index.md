## About this component

Error summary is used along with [Error message](/components/error-message/) to let users know when theyâ€™ve made any errors in a form and how to fix them.

Error messages appear next to single fields throughout the page. But error summary summarises all the errors at the top, so that a user can get a simple list view.

Error summary also allows users to click through to each single error from the top of the page.

## Why we use this component

Our design of error summary is based on the GOV.UK approach, however we have been tested this component and have found it works well with users. 

Research showed users:

* understood what went wrong
* knew how to fix the problem and carry on
* were able to recover from the error

## Website analytics
To understand the incidence of validation error messages, they can be tracked through the original page path, the error text, and a data attribute showing the type of error.

The data attribute is added automatically by the [Design System's 'tracking' script](/get-started/tracking/#error-summary).
