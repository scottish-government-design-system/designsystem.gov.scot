## Website analytics

Select components can be tracked through custom events and the original page path. Custom events are used as the data isn't available at the instant an option is chosen and the clicktext could potentially contain personally identifiable information.

The data attribute is added automatically by the [Design System's 'tracking' script](/get-started/tracking/#select-dropdown).
