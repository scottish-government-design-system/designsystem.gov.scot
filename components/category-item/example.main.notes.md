### Configuration options

The link colour of the category item's title can also be overridden, though blue is more commonly recognised as a link colour.

`$category-item__link-color`

Your value for this should be included before you include the SCSS file.

    $category-item__link-color: darkred;
    @import '/path/to/components/category-item/category-item';
