## About this component

The date picker is a component that helps users to complete date input fields. To help with accessibility, it can be used with a keyboard, as well as mouse or touchscreen.

The date picker can be set with limits on the dates that users can select.

The date picker component can use a variety of date formats, with the UK style of _date/month/year_ used by default.

## Why we use this component

Date pickers are a common component that helps users select and enter a date.

## Website analytics

To understand user behaviour, clicks on date picker items can be tracked through the original page path, the click text, and a data attribute showing the element interacted with.

Clicks on buttons inside a date picker, including 'OK', 'Cancel' and the month navigation buttons are tracked using the standard [Button tracking](/components/button/). Data attributes for these are added automatically by the [Design System's 'tracking' script](/guidance/tracking/).

## Implementation

The date picker component needs JavaScript enabled in the userâ€™s browser. If a user does not have JavaScript enabled the text field will behave as normal, without the date picker enhancements.

### Date formats

Use an attribute of `data-dateformat` on the input element to specify one of the following. If none is provided it defaults to `DMY`.

* `DMY` - 14th March 2020 would be written as `14/03/2020`
* `MDY` - 14th March 2020 would be written as `03/14/2020`
* `YMD` - 14th March 2020 would be written as `2020/03/14`

### Allowed date ranges

Use an attribute of `data-mindate` on the input element to specify an earliest possible date for the calendar. Dates before this date cannot be selected.

Use an attribute of `data-maxdate` on the input element to specify a latest possible date for the calendar. Dates after this date cannot be selected.

The date format used for both of these is whatever you specify in `data-dateformat` or the default, `DMY`.

### JavaScript

Set up a date picker by creating a new DatePicker object. It takes two parameters:

* the DOM element of the date picker (element with class `ds_datepicker`)
* an optional object of customisation settings

The customisation settings can have the following properties:

* `imagePath`: the path to the location of your icons sprite. Default is `/assets/images/icons/`
* `maxDate`: a JavaScript date object for the latest selectable date
* `minDate`: a JavaScript date object for the earliest selectable date

{% include inset-text.html content="Minimum and maximum dates that have been set using JavaScript will overwrite minimum and maximum dates that have been specified with data attributes." %}

### Example JavaScript

{% highlight javascript %}
const datePicker = new window.DS.components.DatePicker(
    document.getElementById('my-date-picker'),
    {
        imagePath: '/my/image/path/',
        maxDate: new Date(),
        minDate: new Date(2019, 1, 1)
    }
);

datePicker.init();
{% endhighlight %}
