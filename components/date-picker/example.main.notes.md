### Date formats

Use an attribute of `data-dateformat` on the input element to specify one of the following. If none is provided it defaults to `DMY`.

* `DMY` - 14th March 2020 would be written as `14/03/2020`
* `MDY` - 14th March 2020 would be written as `03/14/2020`
* `YMD` - 14th March 2020 would be written as `2020/03/14`

### Allowed date ranges

Use an attribute of `data-mindate` on the input element to specify an earliest possible date for the calendar. Dates before this date cannot be selected.

Use an attribute of `data-maxdate` on the input element to specify a latest possible date for the calendar. Dates after this date cannot be selected.

The date format used for both of these is whatever you specify in `data-dateformat` or the default, `DMY`.
