summary: "Components are parts of code that can be easily lifted and reused. They’re usually self-contained elements of a website, such as a banner, breadcrumb or button."

You can reuse each component in the Digital Scotland Design System with no or minimal changes. If you prefer, you can also adapt a component’s code to better meet what your users need.

If you’re looking to significantly alter how a component works or looks, it’s best to test your new version with a wide range of users to make sure the changes work well.
