## About this component

A feature header has:

* a title
* optional content that describes whatâ€™s on the page
* an optional image

If an image is used on a feature header header, the image will stack below the text content of a category header on a mobile device and take up the full screen width.

The image will appear on the right-hand side of a feature header on a desktop, taking up half of the available width of the header.

## Other versions of this component

### Coloured background

Feature headers may use a coloured background instead of white, with light grey being the default. If you use a coloured background you must ensure that all text on the feature header still meets colour contrast requirements.

{% include example-frame.html title="Feature header example with a coloured background" name="colour" %}

### Wide text

You can use the wide text version of the component to make the text take two thirds of the available space and make the image take up one third of the space.

This version can be combined with the coloured background version.

{% include example-frame.html title="Feature header example with wide text area" name="wide" %}
