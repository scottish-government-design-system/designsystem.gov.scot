                <h2>Leasehold campaigners welcome new changes</h2>
                <p class="ds_leader">Two big players in the leasehold sector have agreed to change the way they operate, following an investigation by the competition watchdog.</p>

                <p>Housebuilder Persimmon will allow its leaseholders to buy the freehold of their property at a discount.</p>

                <p>Insurance company Aviva, which buys leaseholds from house builders, will repay homeowners who saw their ground rents double.</p>

                <p>Campaigners for leaseholders said the commitments were a "massive milestone".</p>

                <h2>What is a leasehold?</h2>
                <p>With a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes.</p>

                <p>When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold.</p>

                <p>But leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell.</p>

                <p>Under the new commitments Aviva will remove ground rent terms the CMA considers unfair and repay homeowners who saw rents doubled.</p>
